I am a Research Fellow at the Simons Institute at UCB for the joint programs MPG and LLM in fall 2024. Before that, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Molei Tao.

## Research

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, sampling, (stochastic) dynamics, and computational math. More precisely, I focus on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, especially from dynamical perspective. Currently, I am interested in large language models and diffusion models.

## Publication

Good regularity creates large learning rate implicit biases: edge of stability, balancing, and catapult
